This project aims to improve the stack overflow search engine by integrating a tag predictor modelled using LSTM. First word2vec model is trained using stack overflow dataset available at stack data exchange and then use that to train our network. Using the embeddings generated, firstly we train a tag classifier model. Henceforth, when a user shoots its query, this classifier predicts the tags that belong to that question. Now based on these predicted tags, we pick the questions from our corpus that have same tags and based on the cosine similarities, we determine the top 'k' questions available in the corpus to flash it to the end user. For lower latency, we embedded all the corpus question sentences into a single vector by averaging the embeddings of all the words in that sentence and stored them in a csv file. Then, when a user fires a query, we get the tags and embed the query into a vector to get the cosine similarities.
